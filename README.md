# S3LongStreamDeck
This is a StreamDeck alike device for HomeAssistant using ESPHome. I find that the [Lilygo T-Display S3 Long](ttps://lilygo.cc/products/t-display-s3-long?pr_prod_strat=jac&pr_rec_id=decea97a3&pr_rec_pid=7526315688117&pr_ref_pid=8060214935733&pr_seq=uniform) Is a nice and affordable device with Touch screen in a nice finish to he front and a ESP32-c3 onboard.
